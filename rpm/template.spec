%description
Online automated pattern-based object tracker relying on visual servoing.
visp_auto_tracker wraps model-based trackers provided by ViSP visual servoing
library into a ROS package. The tracked object should have a QRcode of Flash
code pattern. Based on the pattern, the object is automaticaly detected. The
detection allows then to initialise the model-based trackers. When lost of
tracking achieves a new detection is performed that will be used to re-
initialize the tracker. This computer vision algorithm computes the pose (i.e.
position and orientation) of an object in an image. It is fast enough to allow
object online tracking using a camera.
