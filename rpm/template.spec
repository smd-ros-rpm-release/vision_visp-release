%description
Wraps the ViSP moving edge tracker provided by the ViSP visual servoing library
into a ROS package. This computer vision algorithm computes the pose (i.e.
position and orientation) of an object in an image. It is fast enough to allow
object online tracking using a camera.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
